This is a highly outdated exploit library for Mhyprot2, the old Genshin Impact anticheat which was vulnerable to IOCTL commands from foreign sources due to horrible encryption and poorly engineered internals. 
This library is capable of kernel level read and write, process enumeration, thread enumeration, memory pattern scanning, and much more.
